=== Async JavaScript for WordPress ===

Help to eliminate Render-blocking JavaScript in above-the-fold content with Async JavaScript.

Render-blocking JavaScript prevents above-the-fold content on your page from being rendered until the JavaScript has finished loading.  

This can impact on your page speed and ultimately your ranking within search engines.  

It can also impact your users experience.

This 'async' or 'defer' attribute forces the javascript to be loaded asynchronously or deferred, therefore speeding up page delivery.
